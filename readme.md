#### A SPA Router Demo
> This app shows how a SPA router works

With this demo I tried to teach how a SPA router works and how client side routing can be done.
If you are very passionate about this server and network related queries you may star this repo 'cause in the next project I will demonstrate how SPA router can help host two or more SPA apps at the same project with same boilerplate.

You can also reach me out through my github profile for more information as I like to help people learn about these things ;)
